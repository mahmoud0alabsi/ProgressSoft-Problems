<h1> Problem-1_FaceBlurring </h1> 

<h2> About Project: </h2>
<p>
In this project, I worked on detecting the faces in the image, then make (Blurring) on the faces in this image.
I used the (openCV2) library and pretrain model (haarcascade_frontalface_default) to complete the process of
recognizing faces and drawing a box around each face.
