Problem-1_FaceBlurring
----------------------
About Project:
In this project, I worked on detecting the faces in the image, then make (Blurring) on the faces in this image.
I used the (openCV2) library and pretrain model (haarcascade_frontalface_default) to complete the process of
recognizing faces and drawing a box around each face.
----------------------

You can run this program from (Google Colab) or (Jupyter notebook).

Run steps:
* Download libraries from (requirements)
* Use (plot_img_bef({image-path})) function to plot image before making blur
* Use (plot_img_aft({image-path})) function to plot image after making blur
